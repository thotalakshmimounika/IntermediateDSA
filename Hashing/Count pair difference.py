# You are given an array A of N integers and an integer B. Count the number of pairs (i,j) such that A[i] - A[j] = B and i â‰  j. Since the answer can be very large, return the remainder after dividing the count with 109+7.


# Problem Constraints
# 1 <= N <= 105
# 1 <= A[i] <= 109
# 1 <= B <= 109


# Input Format
# First argument A is an array of integers and second argument B is an integer.


# Output Format
# Return an integer.


# Example Input
# Input 1:

# A = [3, 5, 1, 2]
# B = 4
# Input 2:

# A = [1, 2, 1, 2]
# B = 1


# Example Output
# Output 1:

# 1
# Output 2:

# 4


# Example Explanation
# Example 1:

# The only pair is (2, 3) which gives difference as 4
# Example 2:

# The pair which gives difference as 3 are (2, 1), (4, 1), (2, 3) and (4, 3). 

class Solution:
    # @param A : list of integers
    # @param B : integer
    # @return an integer
