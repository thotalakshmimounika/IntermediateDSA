# You are given two matrices A & B of equal dimensions and you have to check whether two matrices are equal or not.

# NOTE: Both matrices are equal if A[i][j] == B[i][j] for all i and j in the given range.



# Problem Constraints
# 1 <= A.size(), B.size() <= 1000

# 1 <= A[i].size(), B[i].size() <= 1000

# 1 <= A[i][j], B[i][j] <= 1000



# Input Format
# First argument is vector of vector of integers representing matrix A.

# Second argument is vector of vector of integers representing matrix B.



# Output Format
# Return 1 if both matrices are equal or return 0.



# Example Input
# Input 1:

# A = [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, 9]]
# B = [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, 9]]
# Input 2:

# A = [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6],[7, 8, 9]]
# B = [[1, 2, 3],[7, 8, 9],[4, 5, 6]]


# Example Output
# Output 1:

# 1
# Output 2:

# 0


# Example Explanation
# Explanation 1:

# ==> Clearly all the elements of both matrices are equal at respective positions.
# Explanation 2:

# ==> Clearly all the elements of both matrices are not equal at respective positions.


class Solution:
    # @param A : list of list of integers
    # @param B : list of list of integers
    # @return an integer
