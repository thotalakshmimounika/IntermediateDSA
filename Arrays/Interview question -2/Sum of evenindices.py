# You are given an array A of length N and Q queries given by the 2D array B of size Q*2. Each query consists of two integers B[i][0] and B[i][1].
# For every query, the task is to calculate the sum of all even indices in the range A[B[i][0]â€¦B[i][1]].

# Note : Use 0-based indexing


# Problem Constraints
# 1 <= N <= 105
# 1 <= Q <= 105
# 1 <= A[i] <= 100
# 0 <= B[i][0] <= B[i][1] < N


# Input Format
# First argument A is an array of integers.
# Second argument B is a 2D array of integers.


# Output Format
# Return an array of integers.


# Example Input
# Input 1:
# A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# B = [   [0,2] 
#         [1,4]   ]
# Input 2:
# A = [2, 1, 8, 3, 9]
# B = [   [0,3] 
#         [2,4]   ]


# Example Output
# Output 1:
# [4, 8]
# Output 2:
# [10, 17]


# Example Explanation
# For Input 1:
# The subarray for the first query is [1, 2, 3] whose sum of even indices is 4.
# The subarray for the second query is [2, 3, 4, 5] whose sum of even indices is 8.
# For Input 2:
# The subarray for the first query is [2, 1, 8, 3] whose sum of even indices is 10.
# The subarray for the second query is [8, 3, 9] whose sum of even indices is 17.
